Teacher: Good morning everyone! Today we are going to learn about the Present Perfect tense.
Student: I always get confused with the Present Perfect and Past Simple.
Teacher: That's a common mistake. The main difference is that Past Simple is for finished actions at a specific time in the past. For example, "I visited Paris in 2010."
Student: And Present Perfect?
Teacher: Present Perfect is for actions that happened at an unspecified time or have a connection to the present. Like "I have visited Paris twice." It implies the experience is what matters, not when it happened.
Student: I see. So if I say "I have lost my keys", it means I still don't have them?
Teacher: Exactly! But if you say "I lost my keys yesterday", maybe you found them later. The time marker "yesterday" forces you to use Past Simple.
Teacher: Now let's look at some vocabulary. Do you know the phrasal verb "give up"?
Student: Does it mean to stop trying?
Teacher: Yes, excellent. "I gave up smoking." Another one is "run out of". It means you have nothing left. "We ran out of milk."
Teacher: Let's practice. Create a sentence with "run out of".
Student: I have run out of money!
Teacher: Perfect! And true for many of us. Remember, "have run" is Present Perfect.
Teacher: For homework, I want you to write 5 sentences using "just", "already", and "yet". These are keywords for the Present Perfect.
